# Learn programming with Tello EDU
This repository contains some simple educational tasks to learn the basics<br/>
of C++ (or any other programming language).<br/>

To complete the tasks, you need the following things:
- This repository
- A Ryze Tech Tello EDU drone
- The exercise-and-solution pdf (included in this repo)<br>
It is place at doc/documentation/learn_with_tello.pdf

## Supported Platforms
At the moment, the tasks are only available for windows (due the lack of implementation for<br/>
other operating systems of the used tello library).<br/>

### Compilers
The following compilers are tested and work:
- nmake

## Installation

### Installation steps
Once you've cloned, forked or whatever the repo, you can make the targets with cmake.<br/>
